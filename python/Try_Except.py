# Try Except
# This code demonstrates the use of try-except blocks in Python to handle exceptions gracefully.
# It includes examples of catching specific exceptions and using a general exception handler.

# Example 1: Basic try-except block
try:
    print("Hello")
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
# Example 2: Catching a specific exception
try:
    x = 5 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Cannot divide by zero:", e)
# Example 3: Catching multiple exceptions
try:
    x = int("Hello")
except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
    print("An error occurred with value conversion:", e)
# Example 4: Using a general exception handler
try:
    x = 5 / 0
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)
# Example 5: Finally block
try:
    x = 5 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Cannot divide by zero:", e)
finally:
    print("This block always executes, regardless of an error.")
# Example 6: Using else with try-except
try:
    x = 5 / 1
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Cannot divide by zero:", e)
else:
    print("Division successful, result is:", x)
# Example 7: Raising an exception               
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b
try:
    result = divide(5, 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
# Example 8: Custom exception class
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass
try:
    raise CustomError("This is a custom error message")
except CustomError as e:
    print("Caught a custom error:", e)
# Example 9: Nested try-except blocks
try:
    try:
        x = int("Hello")
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Inner exception caught:", e)
    x = 5 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Outer exception caught:", e)
# Example 10: Using try-except with file operations
try:
    with open("non_existent_file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print("File not found:", e)
# Example 11: Handling multiple exceptions in a single except block
try:
    x = int("Hello")
    y = 5 / 0
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
# Example 12: Using try-except with user input
try:
    user_input = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print("You entered:", user_input)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Invalid input, please enter a valid number:", e)
# Example 13: Using try-except with a function call
def risky_function():
    return 1 / 0
try:
    risky_function()
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Caught an error in risky_function:", e)
# Example 14: Using try-except with a loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 0, 4]
for number in numbers:
    try:
        result = 10 / number
        print("Result:", result)
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Cannot divide by zero for number:", number, "Error:", e)
# Example 15: Using try-except with a context manager
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):

        print("Inside the context")
        x = 5 / 0  # This will raise an exception
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Caught an error in the context manager:", e)
# Example 16: Using try-except with assertions
try:
    assert 1 == 2, "This assertion will fail"
except AssertionError as e:
    print("Assertion error caught:", e)
# Example 17: Using try-except with a decorator

# Example 20: Using try-except with a lambda function
try:

        print("Count:", count)
